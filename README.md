This Python script processes incoming emails in a Gmail account, transcribes any attached audio files (WAV, MP3, OGG formats), and sends the transcription along with the original attachments to a specified email address.

## Features

- Connects to Gmail using Google API and a service account key file.
- Processes incoming emails with audio attachments (WAV, MP3, OGG).
- Transcribes audio files using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
- Detects the language of the transcription using Google Cloud Translation API.
- Translates the transcription, if necessary, using the same API.
- Sends the transcription and the original attachments to a specified email address.

## Setup

1. Set up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and enable the required APIs (Gmail, Speech-to-Text, Translation).
2. Create a service account key file (JSON) with the necessary permissions.
3. Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client google-cloud-speech google-cloud-translate
```

4. Run the script with the path to the service account key file and the recipient email address as command-line arguments:

```
python email_audio_transcription.py path/to/api_key_file.json recipient_email@example.com
```

Replace `path/to/api_key_file.json` with the path to your Google Cloud service account key file in JSON format, and `recipient_email@example.com` with the desired recipient email address.
